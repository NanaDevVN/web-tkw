      "Civilization is dead, but Chito and Yuuri are still alive.",
      "So they hop aboard their Kettenkrad motorbike and aimlessly wander the ruins of the world they once knew.",
      "Day after hopeless day, they look for their next meal and fuel for their ride.",
      "But as long as they are together, even an existence as bleak as theirs has a ray or two of sunshine in it, whether they're sucking down their fill of soup or hunting for machine parts to tinker with.",
      "The experiences and feelings these two girls share in a world full of nothing give them something to live forâ€¦"
